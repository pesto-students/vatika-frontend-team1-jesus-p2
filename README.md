Vatika is a company helping city dwellers who are looking to keep plants but do not have access to a nursery and also donâ€™t know how to create and maintain a garden in a limited space. 

-It's easy enough to buy plants but keeping healthy is another thing altogether. 
-Vatika uses a website chat service and its own social media sites to help   customers pick the right pots and plants and give them all the knowledge and information they need to get a garden going.
